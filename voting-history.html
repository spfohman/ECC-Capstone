                <p>The earliest forms of voting in the US was with paper and pencil. Ballots were drafted by each party rather than a neutral entity. That lasted into the 19th century. Paper ballots were hard to count, the counting could be error prone.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The first automation occurred around 1892 with the mechanical voting machine in Lockport, NY. It was large and heavy which deterred theft. IT also kept ballot votes secret and helped avoid ballot spoiling. It made counting faster, making the process more economical. A counter outside the machine guarded against ballot stuffing. In 1964 two thirds of voting was still done with these machines. In 1980 it was down to 40%, and as recently as 2008 there was still 6% in use. </p><br>

                <p>The next real development did not come until 1960s with the development of the Hollerith punch card. There were two major companies that vied for business, Votomatic and DataVote. In 1980 one third of voting was still done this way. This method is what created the “hanging chad” debate from the 2000 election in Bush v. Gore. They stopped use of this method around 2010.</p><br>
                <p>In 1960 there was also the development of machines that could scan a paper and ink ballot, like a standardized test. This method has grown in popularity. It started out at about 2% use in 1980. Then 30% in 2000, up to 60% in 2008.</p><br>
                <p>The most advanced method developed widely was the Direct Recording Electronic device (DRE) in the 1970s. It is a mechanical lever machine combined with push buttons and lights. As technology developed, they started to look more like ATM machines. There are issues with this method however as it did not have an auditable paper trail.</p><br>

                <p>In the early 2000s DRE became unpopular because the source code of a major vendor was leaked online. When audited many defects were found. People could also access the smart cards for the machines as they were not secure. Anyone could access and update the software without a passcode or security protocols.  The company even posted an image of the key that locked the machine, and it was copyable. This organization, Diebold was the precursor for Dominion which is one of the companies under scrutiny from the 2020 election.</p><br>

                <p>In the 2000s there was a push to vote via the internet. This is primarily taking place for absentee and military voters. If expanded, they could possibly reach more voters, especially in primary elections where turnout is low, or in areas underserved by in person voting options. </p><br>
                <p>The possible technological needs to make online voting secure would be a combination of biometrics and blockchain technology. </p>
                <p>Currently one of the only countries to allow for elections via the internet is Estonia. It is possible there due to a smaller voter population.</p>
